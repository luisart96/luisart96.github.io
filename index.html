									<p>My name is <strong>Arturo Dominguez</strong>, I am a 26 years-old mechatronics engineer really interested in 
										software development, specially game developing and virtual and augmented reality, I feel we have a huge future 
										with these technologies because we already are using them but I believe we do not take advantage of all they 
										have to offer to us.</p>

										<p>I have always wanted to keep my knowledge up to date and learning new things, specially technology related 
											things and I have been working in my own at game and extended reality development. During covid-19 quarantine 
											was when I learnt the most about it while generating income with a friend. If you are interested in what I have 
											done in my career, here are the projects:</p>

									<p>This is my favorite of all, it is a mobile app developed in Unreal Engine 4, due covid-19, 
										several local businesses were severely affected because they used to go to local bazaar or 
										small markets to sell their products and when covid arrived, all those bazaars were cancelled, 
										our purpose was help people show their brand and products through our app without having to 
										go out and risk your health.</p>
