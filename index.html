									<p>My name is <strong>Arturo Dominguez</strong>, I am a 26 year-old mechatronics engineer very interested in 
										software development, specially game developing as well as virtual and augmented reality.

									<p>I believe there is a huge future with these technologies since we as a society are nowadays using them, however I 
										do believe we are not still taking full advantage of what they have to offer us.</p>

									<p>I am always interested in keeping my knowledge up to date and learning new things, specially technology related. 
											Specifically during Covid-19 quarantine, I took the time to learn on my own, work and launch my own startup
											for game and extended reality development.</p>
									<p>If you are interested in what I have done in my career, please feel free to review my projects below.</p>
